# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities. Which versions are eligible receiving such patches depend on the CVSS v3.0 Rating:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report vulnerabilities by emailing [reahtuoo310109@gmail.com](mailto:reahtuoo310109@gmail.com). Please include:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Possible impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

We will acknowledge receipt within 24 hours and provide updates on remediation progress.

## Security Measures

### Input Validation
- All file paths are validated and sanitized
- Document inputs are processed in isolated environments
- User inputs are escaped and validated
- File type restrictions are enforced

### File Processing Security
- Temporary files are created in secure directories
- All temporary files are cleaned up after processing
- File size limits are enforced to prevent DoS attacks
- Malicious file detection and rejection

### External Dependencies
- Regular security updates for all dependencies
- Vulnerability scanning using automated tools
- Minimal dependency footprint to reduce attack surface
- Security-focused dependency selection

### Process Isolation
- LibreOffice processes run with restricted permissions
- Browser instances are sandboxed
- Command execution is parameterized to prevent injection
- Network access is restricted for processing operations

### Data Protection
- No data is sent to external servers
- All processing happens locally
- Sensitive data is not logged
- Configuration files are protected with appropriate permissions

## Security Best Practices

### For Users
- Keep the software updated to the latest version
- Use strong file permissions for sensitive documents
- Regularly audit the documents being processed
- Monitor system resources during processing

### For Developers
- Run security scans before commits
- Follow secure coding practices
- Validate all inputs and outputs
- Use parameterized queries for any database operations

## Security Headers and Configuration

When deploying this MCP server:

- Ensure proper file system permissions
- Use principle of least privilege
- Configure appropriate resource limits
- Monitor system logs for suspicious activity
- Implement network segmentation if applicable

## Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. Immediately assess the impact
2. Isolate affected systems if necessary
3. Document the incident
4. Apply patches or workarounds
5. Notify affected users if data exposure occurred
6. Conduct post-incident review

## Security Updates

Security updates will be:
- Released as patch versions (1.0.x)
- Announced via GitHub releases
- Documented in CHANGELOG.md
- Backported to supported versions when feasible
